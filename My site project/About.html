        Hello Welcome To My Blog. Here I will write about my coding journey. I
        hope you enjoy what you read here. It all started one day when I seen
        someone code online the words "Hello World". I took my lap top and as
        soon as I did it myself I was amazed and felt I was on top of the world.
        I've been hooked on coding ever since. I started looking for information
        on what I needed to learn to code. Along the way I found out that
        Software Engineers make a hefty paycheck. The light bulb went off. Not
        only did I love coding I could make a good living doing it. Boy, did I
        get even more motivated and excited about the journey I was about to
        take. I searched and found a road map to what I needed to learn to code
        professionally. I've currently learned HTML and CSS. I am now learning
        JavaScript. This has been an amazing journey so far and can't wait to
        see where it will take me from here.
